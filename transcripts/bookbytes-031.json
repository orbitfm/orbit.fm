And I’ve been going over section two, I think one of the things that we didn’t get into that much last time was actually talking a bit about the difference between Google and Apple. I thought Kim was actually pretty unique in that she got an experience in both companies and got to compare the ways that they both have a level of radical candor in them, but how, I guess, Google is very much in the mindset of being growth minded around how they run all their operations; and it makes sense in that a lot of their work there is number driven. Like, if you can measure it then you can go and improve it."

And also the same thing can exist with people and performances, they may have a skew there or a bias towards people who are often elevating their numbers."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:02:17.5",
      "text": "And the flip of it that I kind of got with Apple, is that when people are hired there, they are brought in because they are supposed to be the best at what they do and so… whereas Google has a strong stance for superstars, those people who are on a growth trajectory and always wanting to grow their responsibility and, just, their influence, Apple, also, seems to have a culture that embraces the rock star type of person more. I say “type of person” but that’s not quite right, it’s more modal. I’d heard an interview from Kim Scott previously that she tried to clarify that; that rock stars and superstars, they are modal things. Like, we shift between those."

Like, whether it is making it so the login screen on iOS just works and it doesn’t screw up all the time. I mean, like, little bits of that. Like, people who really hone in on that and, I mean, that is a practice that was done, kind of, from top down."

      "timestamp": "0:04:06.1",

And the way that they handled communication was also very different. One of them tended to be direct but, kind of, gave you the opportunity to learn something, or make that choice before they were extremely direct."

I mean, it’s something you definitely have to grow to, but I have been in situations where, like, I mean…"

(laughs) So I ended up pair programming with a coworker for the entire pregnancy. It was a 9 month pair programming session and it was incredible, and we very much did the same thing. We got really good at just being able to read each other and we did clear out a lot of those common courtesies, I guess, that you have in standard conversation and even work relationships."

And not only that, but when I came back and started coding after the project was done, it felt like I had lost half of my brain. It was so hard to get back into the swing of things. And it’s not that I didn’t code for 9 months it was just that he spent more time at the keyboard than I did. So I had a very much big picture role, he had the highly focused role, but it was a really productive development format, and it does take a certain pair of people in order to make that work."

And because of the fact that we usually had a particular position in that, it meant that I could keep, like, the entire project in my head and how all the pieces were intertwined while he worked on the very specific details of what it was going to entail to write the small piece. And then as he was coding, I could make sure that what he was writing on the screen, essentially, was going to coincide and work with the pieces that were coming next and the pieces that already existed.

There’s a lot of thought that goes into development. It’s not all hands on keyboard."

So rather than starting off radical candor in a front where you are telling somebody else things that they’re able to improve on, if you go and open up that venue, then, I mean, that makes yourself able to improve."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:13:04.3",
      "text": "And so, I mean, if you are a dev and, like, in the position of feeling like you need to crank for 8 hours a day on a keyboard, I mean, without stopping? I mean, imagine if you stopped for, I don’t know, some odd period of time every day to try and get feedback from some other peer, be like, “How could I improve this?” I mean, I think that is a great thing that pull requests and stuff, encourage but to go and get that feedback and get that criticism that you can work off of, like, how much more productive would you be in seven hours rather than eight if you were using one hour to actually find your flaws and improve?"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:13:51.3",
      "speaker": "Jen Luker",
      "text": "I think, on top of that, trying to go to others and asking for that level of radical candor does set up the safe space required to give it as well as receive it because at least when you’re going to them and asking for it, you’ve already, kind of, put yourself in a place to receive it without getting hurt and insulted."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:14:13.9",
      "text": "And then by developing that level of communication, understanding that this is how you act when radical candor is received, they get that… safety net, knowing that this is how it’s going to be when they can give you honest feedback; and then they start to adopt that for themselves so that when you start going to them and saying, “Okay, I need to give you feedback.” They’re like, “Yes, let’s go.”"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:14:38.8",
      "text": "So it kind of gives, it develops that level of safe space and that level of familiarity and understanding and expected outcomes that if they give you feedback and you either seriously consider it and return with information or you seriously consider it and make the change, that at least they know that that feedback loop is completed."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:14:58.6",
      "speaker": "Jason Staten",
      "text": "Definitely. I, yeah, I think you’re right. It, kind of, lays the groundwork and the expectations of what can be interpreted by criticism. Like, much like if you say, or if you receive criticism and then, a really important part of it that Kim mentions is actually going and acting on that in whatever way is necessary. I mean, you may not necessarily take specific advice from the criticism, but hearing the criticism and then making it clear, like, this is your response to it, then it does make it clear that it is a forum and you’re wanting that so you can improve, not just so you can soak it in and then ignore others."

      "timestamp": "0:16:07.4",

    {
      "timestamp": "0:16:22.6",
      "text": "So if you really want to establish the environment for making criticism all right, if you have a specific person on your team or a direct report that is really good at criticizing you, asking that person to make remarks in a more public setting can be a good way of also establishing that environment; because not everybody is as able to go and let their mind be known. And so, if you do that publicly, you, first, you can be more efficient in that you may not hear the same piece of feedback from five different people in various one-on-ones, but instead, I mean, you can get one person to say something and then four other head nods or something, to say, “Oh yeah, this does ring true with several others.”"

When I started asking for feedback and nobody would tell me anything. It was always like, “Yeah. Yeah. Everything’s great. You’re great. We’re all cool. Move on.” And it took months of me asking for it and giving it before they started giving it back."

So it becomes an unconscious training exercise (laughs). Teaching others how to do that. And maybe with that in mind, the level of feedback that you get starts being more honest and also more forthcoming. Your mind mind wouldn’t go blank so quickly, or their mind wouldn’t go blank so quickly, when it was time for feedback."

But make sure, like, if you’re receiving something, ask questions about it to go and make sure it’s clear on what somebody is saying to you and like, if they’re not specific about something, or if you want to know on what something they would recommend is, but then even taking that and saying, “Okay, I will take that and I will get back to you shortly on it.” And then actually getting back to them shortly, or doing something in response to it shortly, but then it’s not like minimizing what their feedback is and it gives you a chance to make an appropriate response rather than a knee jerk reaction."

Even that is something that you can do as a recipient of criticism is to say, “I’m doing this, thank you to the criticism or the remarks that I received from such and such.” Like, if you do need to even draw it back, like, you should definitely make it known that it is well received."

So trying to stay away from those personal labels and saying the behavior fits this label, this action fits this label, this piece of work fits this label; then our brains accept that as opposed to the person being something because people are adaptable.

That may be, like, that may be in more of the situation where you take somebody aside privately and talk to them, but as soon as you can do that, do it. Because you can, first, you can give the clearest recollection of it because you just saw it happen; whereas, if you see something and then you think to yourself, “Oh, well I’ve got a one-on-one in a week. I’ll talk to them about it then.” Then in a week’s time your view of it may be different because, as humans, our brains, they are very lossy mediums and we have a tendency to lose a lot of details over time to be efficient in what is there.

So that can go both ways but I don’t think that that necessarily means that you shouldn’t give criticism. I think sometimes it’s a matter of defining when you are crossing that gender boundary that you are a little bit more explicit about, “I’m going to give you criticism now.” And give a few seconds to transition modes."

I mean, she explicitly says that criticism is a gift. Like, if we don’t tell people how they can improve then they won’t. Like, we all have blind spots and that’s what we can definitely rely on each other to help call out so that way we can improve and improve those things and just generally get better. They can be more productive in a workplace, like, happier as people. Like, it could be things that even we put off as minor but can be pretty important."

It’s that while we, like, if we don’t give criticism in equal manner, like if women just don’t have that and it detracts from their progression in their careers that whereas say, Bob gets promoted because he’s receiving the criticism he needs and he’s improving; and Alice isn’t getting the feedback she needs to know how to improve, then how much faster of a career trajectory can he be on versus Alice if she’s not getting that same level?"

Like, that can influence a whole lot. Like, whether it’s if you get a job that you are making peanuts and then stick around there for a long time because of whatever reason, and then don’t ever get the feedback you need to, like, progress to a higher role, like, if you stay at a job and they keep you as a Junior Engineer for three years or something like that, whereas other people happen to move from junior to some other, like, mid-level or something like that, quicker, like, that makes a huge impact where you are 10 years down the line.
