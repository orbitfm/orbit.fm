So last time we talked about the tech, like the websites, apps, and just other technology and how they’re insensitive, or non inclusive, or destructive, or harmful to a lot of people, and this week we’re talking about the companies and the people that make this tech, and how we got here, why things are the way they are, why this tech isn’t considering all the use cases for all its users, and why there isn’t more diversity within these companies."

The more that you stay interacting with their products the more they make on everything from advertising to selling your information. So, when it comes down to it, it really, really does come down to money."

And I say this because there’s a lot of research that’s been done that proves that when you have more inclusive and diverse teams, you earn more profits. That when you have diverse board of directors, diverse leadership, you make more money as a business. You get more customers, you can reach out to more people. So, if this was, you know, this like purely capitalist, every owner’s just out to get the money and that’s all it was, then there would be more people who were underrepresented and marginalized in the tech industry because it is the rational thing to do from a financial perspective for your business; But, the reality is that a lot of it is centered on the fact that tech emerged as a new industry but followed existing power structures and those existing power structures were ones that tended to favor men, specifically White men and then just kind of structured everybody else as below that. And that’s kind of the way that I see it."

And you’re right that the research shows that more diversity breeds and creates more money, but the thought doesn’t occur. It’s kind of contrary to what the culture itself has been taught is true."

So, all of its predictions are based on the past which were more racist and sexist than we are intending the future to be, and I think that, again, that comes down to the fact that the culture is still in the process of change, and it may still be at the very beginning of change."

And I think this is best highlighted in the story that was presented in chapter 2. A brief summary of it: A woman, I’m not sure if she was a woman of color, is trying to make a case for a product decision and she’s consistently ignored and put down a little bit by her White male colleagues and you know, the product ends up flopping.

And I would say, easy, which is another reason why it just kind of perpetuates the problem of rather than stretching yourself in terms of your own personal network and your company at large to get a more diverse company set up. Instead, it’s taking in who you know and saying, “Well, you know, we got a position filled and they can do it, so that’s all we need.” When in fact, that’s a very lazy approach, I would say."

As every company states, there’s a long ways to go, but they are taking a couple of good steps. Firstly they brought on, actually, a director to help assisting in getting that training initiated, so I, myself, have not actually participated in one just yet, but the program is underway and they do have somebody on that. And another thing that Domo is actually leading on is an effort that can be found at parity.org, and the idea behind Parity.org is companies can go and pledge that before they hire for any position, VP or above, that, much like what’s known as “The Rudy Rule” in the NFL where a diverse coach, or a diverse person needs to be interviewed for a head coach position, for the companies that take the parity.org pledge, they will commit to, any position VP or above, to interview at least one woman. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to hire based on some hard metric, but they will interview with that and then starting with women and branching out to greater sets of diversity, as well. I think it is a good step. I think there’s still a ways to go, but I know at least now they did a push towards a lot of NASDAQ companies and there are at least 300 companies that are signed onto that now."

Adam, I think you didn’t have any provided by your company, and then Jason, that’s soon to happen. Okay. See, I asked that just because I think it’s one of those weird things. It’s sort of a chicken and egg problem, at least for me personally. I find that in order for companies to be very proactive about inclusion at their organizations they need to have somebody who is some sort of marginalized individual in a leadership position who can advocate for those things and push them, but usually for that person to get there they have to overcome a lot of the biases and microaggressions that happen daily in the office so then they can change the environment that they rose up in."

And that’s not something personally that I’ve had to go through, and it, at the same time, seems like a common pattern to me is to push somebody out that’s different than the rest of the company through a kind of formal means in some way to say like, “No, we’re not doing anything wrong.” It just… Kind of being, behind the scenes, sexist or racist or so forth."

So, some of the questions that I would ask is, you know, what kind of metrics or dimensions do you assess in your performance reviews? How often do you do performance reviews? How do performance reviews correlate with bonuses or raises? How do performance reviews correlate with positions changes or like, you know, rank raises. There might have been a couple of other questions that I asked, but, you know, it was actually something that hadn’t even come to mind for me until Coraline’s experiences and other underrepresented and marginalized individuals started to come out about the review process and how it can be a formal way of discriminating or ostracizing individuals. And I was like, “Oh! I should, you know, try and use that as a way to vet companies and see how much time and thought they put into their review process and how it can potentially be gained to do more harm than good.”"

Like, I was thinking about one of the stories in this book is about how the HR process was so terrible And so, like, maybe that’s another questions you would ask is what does the HR do about violations?"

Ask about reviews, ask about HR processes, and I think that’s a good thing. I think oftentimes when I see like, blog posts or stuff written for developers they’re like, “What kind of things should you ask about your job when you’re interviewing the company?” It’s generally things like what’s remote work like? Or, you know, what laptop do you give? Or what technology do you use? Or hours and stuff, but I think the more developers start to ask companies, at the interview process, about their reviews, HR, how people are managed in the organization, the more companies will start seeing that as a priority and something they should improve on if they want to attract and retain hires."

So, for instance, if you use like, “How many women are in technology?” Or, “How do you market these things to women?” You look at the statistics of people that are interacting with your product. So, like, Stack Overflow for instance has like a 92% men use it versus an 8%ish like, women use it, right? So, if you’re looking at that then you’d think that approximately 92% of programmers are men, and that’s not necessarily true. There’s a lot of additional factors that go into why women don’t contribute to websites such as Stack Overflow. You take that into account and then you also take into account that if you do not provide your gender that there are algorithms to try to identify what your gender is based on the sites that you go to and the activities that you partake in. So, if you’re really into sports or you look up a lot of developer websites then they may think that you’re a man, whether you’re not or you are is irrelevant. They just classify you as such. As a woman who interacts with a lot of things that would be technically classified as male dominated, they would not classify me as female and therefore in statistics I would come up as part of that male analytic, even though that’s inaccurate. So, making assumptions based on data makes, you know, gets more and more inaccurate over time."

      "text": "Right, so you take that and you also look at the fact that there’s now new products that are out on the market that try to say that they’re unbiased. So, they’re trying to use generic information based on like, a profile that you’re providing to try to find better people that would match your demographic or your profile in order to improve your hiring and your attrition statistics. So, if you insert someone who’s like, “Take my best developer and I want them to also have like, better soft skills.” The software itself, based on all of this data that we’ve had before, is now looking at this person saying, “Okay, well they were in a fraternity, and they went to a high end school, and they also did these other things. So, let’s look for people like that.” These people are going to rank better for you than someone who maybe went to a state school and you know, weren’t quite as involved in as much extracurricular activities. So, you end up with breed- you know, like works with like, and you just end up with more people that are like yourself, and you really miss out on a lot of the diversity that is available and out there and would be even better than the job than yet another person that’s just like you. And so, when we’re looking at this data, and when we’re working with this data, we have to be asking those questions, and those are questions that we necessarily haven’t been trained specifically to ask. Like,what are the biases that our data is, in fact, built with? And how are we going to work with that data in order to counteract that? So, it may be unbiased in the fact that it’s doing exactly like you told it to, “Find someone like my developer but with better soft skills.” But it doesn’t do a very good job of finding diverse hires. So, you end up, again, with just the same people and wondering what the pipeline- And that was the argument against the pipeline, that’s where I was going with this. Is that when you’re looking at that, you’re saying there’s a pipeline problem, there’s only 8% of women that use Stack Overflow, which based on whether you’ve provided your gender or not and they’re just demographic profiling you based on the websites you go to, it may be more like 25% or it may be 50% for all we know, but because of the fact that the data is biased, it says 92% versus less."

The idea was they would have Google engineers come teach classes at Howard, and then some Howard students would come in and, I think it was like quasi-internships at Google, I really don’t want to mess up the facts on any of this, but my initial reaction when I read the information about it was this feeling that the kids at the historically Black College, HBCU, had to do more to get a foot in the door at Google, than somebody from MIT who could slap their resume into one of Google’s application pages and like, check all the boxes on their automated filters. And like, I get it. I get that, as marginalized individuals, sometimes you need extra support and help to get to a point where you know you can get into the door, but I don’t know, sometimes for me personally it feels like that thing where people are trying to support you and, you know, give you resources, the tone of it can sometimes mean, “You’re not good enough, so we need to give you these things to be better.” Not, “There is a system that oppresses you. That is not your fault. So, we’re going to attempt to improve the situation by giving you these resources.” And sometimes the blame can be put on the marginalized individuals themselves to adhere to the standards of the pipeline, not on like, the whole system that disadvantages certain individuals. And maybe that’s just a tone that I’m reading in some of like, the programs and things that I get emails about, but sometimes it feels a little bit like, “You gotta do more, you gotta be better.” Not, “We failed you.”"

And there’s a podcast episode on “This American Life” about him where one of the biggest challenges that he and many other people who are blind face is that people’s expectations of them are lower than that of somebody who’s sighted. Like, the fact that he’s able to ride a bicycle being questioned by people when in fact, I mean, he’s well equipped other than having immediate vision, but he has a fully functioning body that can do thing. And what can often happen is people who are disadvantaged for, whether it be gender, sex, or disability, or anything else, is that the expectations of people around them can even set them up, or people can fulfill those expectations, and instead do worse or think to themselves, “I’m not cut out for this field”, because people have expectations that they’re not going to be, maybe an amazing developer, or a successful developer. You know, if they’re constantly getting, just given low bars to achieve over, like, that’s all that they can strive for. So, I think even in one way, like people may feel like they have good intentions, and that they’re trying to get somebody in that is diverse, at the same time, by lowering that bar, it’s actually a hindrance to that person.

And I’m thinking about this specifically in the context of a recent event that occurred as we’re recording this podcast with Theranos, which is a startup company that ended up being a huge hoax, and you know, was basically a waste of investor money and there was a lot of deception and stuff associated with it. And some of the commentary that I’ve been seeing in the community of Black women who are also in the startup world, whether as founders or as investors, is the fact that sometimes the bar can be raised to a very high extent if you’re an underrepresented individual, that people won’t invest in you. And I think that maybe it is lowering the bar/raising it, but people won’t invest in you or, you know, task you with managing that big project, or hire you because they believe that you can’t do it, and because they believe they can’t do it they end up more rigorously questioning you, you know, they want to know everything about your company’s financials. They want to know every flaw in your product or your team, and just this incessant grilling on your business, which is fair. Like, companies can do their due diligence, but that same level of rigor and examination isn’t often afforded to organizations or opportunities that are given to individuals who, in the case of Theranos, are White women or individuals who are White men. That sometimes you do have to respond to like, severe inquiry and doubt before you can get in somewhere, which I guess is kind of the reverse of lowering the bar. So it’s weird because, you know, sometimes… And I had this with my interview process recently, like, I’ll go into a company and I won’t know if they’re the kind of place that thinks I’m not worth it and is going to grill me really hard, or thinks that I must suck so they gotta make it easy for me. And those are like, 2 different approaches, or 2 different experiences that I’ve had which is it’s either lowered or raised. Which is confusing because you can never tell what you’re getting into."

So, male candidate who admits they don’t know something are seen as, you know, promising and willing to learn and look up things. But a woman who’s seen as not knowing something is seen as inexperienced and it can be not just, it’s that subconscious bias that also comes into play. So, even if the questions are the same the perception can still be different. And we really, really have to step out of ourselves and be very conscious of our own unconscious bias in order to try to circumvent that process, too. It can be quite difficult."

So, what’s expected of me is different than what’s expected of you in even a leadership role. So, sometimes some of the feedback I get is very much based on that. It’s like, “Well, you know, you were pretty stern about that…” And sometimes it’s, “Well, you weren’t listening and I had to get stern in order for you to listen to me.” Whereas, watching someone else do that on a similar team, but he’s a man, on his team he’s seen as taking control and leading the charge, and it can be exhausting trying to both be a leader and make my team better, while also fulfilling the perceptions of what other people think I should be."

And she was so impressive and in so many aspects. She did designs, she could do a level of development. She could do finance work. She just… So like, multifaceted and amazing to work with, and her, I guess one flaw, that I guess would say was taken up by the owner of the company was that she would commit to something and wouldn’t always hit the deadline exactly. And I was like, I’m a developer. I have plenty of times, myself that I don’t hit a deadline. I mean, there’s so many positives and yet something like that slips and like, it was so judged against. And there was like, one particular instance where she had stayed up all night to put together this report and didn’t quite have it done in time for some like, 9:00 am conference call, and she was on the verge of actually getting fired, and I was at lunch with this guy and I actually put my foot down pretty hard to say like, “We need her here. Like, she is the reason why our company is running as well as it is today. And we can’t go and let a mistake like this be the reason for letting somebody so key and essential for company go.” And it was something that I did and you know, I talk about it now and I don’t want to make myself sound like a person who has always done this, because this is something that has been a rare act for me and I guarantee you there are opportunities that I’ve missed in order to put my privilege to use to assist others who are in need. But it was one particular case where I feel like I could learn from as a positive experience for me, to continue to do, because that’s a case where I was able to help and did extend her time there for a little while longer. I mean, she eventually did move on. But, yeah. That is one experience I had were someone like me, being a developer, I mean, we’re all developers here, how many times have we let deadlines slip? And I mean, it’s part of it.

If you look her up online, I'm sure you can find her social media and stuff, but she does a lot of work on diversity and inclusion and one of the terms that I really like that she… I don’t know if invented it, but I’ve seen her use it a lot, is the concept of being a “power ally” and a power ally is, you know, not just any ally or supporter of underrepresented and marginalized individuals, it’s actually somebody who’s going to go in and advocate or say something, or put their own reputation and safety and comfort on the line for the sake of somebody else. So, I really like that term, and I would say if you are listening and you’re somebody who’s interested in getting some interesting perspectives on diversity and inclusion you should definitely check out Kim Crayton’s work and some of her ideas. She’s got some really interesting thoughts on D&I from a business perspective and how people can approach it more proactively."

So, I think sometimes it’s good as somebody’s who’s, you know, in a position of privilege to be uncomfortable and think about times where maybe you weren’t the good guy, and where you like,dropped the ball on something, or where you inflicted more harm than good and, you know, let yourself wallow in that discomfort but then also think about how you can improve and be better in the future.
