      "text": "We are a group of people that are interested in improving our craft and one of the ways that we know to do that is by reading books and discussing them with one another so we can get an outside perspective, and I'm really excited to be a part of it."

And currently, I'm at a consulting company, so I get to move around to a lot of different clients and work on their front-end with JavaScript and React, and currently learning Elm. I have started knitting, but I don't knit that often, and currently I'm really into typewriters."

Currently you can find me contributing to open source, blogging on my blog, which is [blog.safia.rocks](https://blog.safia.rocks/), and running my solo bootstrapped startup, called [Tanmu Labs](https://tanmulabs.com/).

He built an app to listen to different police scanner feeds and issue real-time alerts on crime. And he works with a lot of people who are interested in civic data and public works. I've always been fascinated about that, but I think it's completely different from ham radio. I might be wrong. I'm just rambling about nothing..."

      "text": "Our first book is called Apprenticeship Patterns by David Hoover and Adewale Oshineye. I first came across this book about 4 years ago, and it was a free book online. It was pretty early in my career and I found it to be very useful, and I think it's still useful today. We're actually recording this after we've all read it. What was everyone's expectations before reading the book and how did that change as you read it?"
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Safia Abdalla",
      "text": "When we initially decided to read the book, I thought that it would be much more thought-leadery and a little self-helpish. As we were reading it, that perspective changed. I realized that it's much more of a technical manual, and as we discussed on the podcast, a set of patterns or communication tools to discuss the same ideas around how our careers develop and what our career goals are."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Jason Staten",
      "text": "When I was first approached by Adam about reading the Apprenticeship Patterns book, I didn't quite know what to expect. The first thing that jumped into mind was the [Gang of Four Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/?tag=adaharris09-20) that I remembered studying in college. And after reading it, it actually made me wish that I had read Apprenticeship Patterns before reading the Gang of Four. It's been really nice to go through as a way of doing some self-assessment and to learn about ways that I can still continue to grow myself as a developer. It's something that I would recommend to any new developer or developer who's looking to progress themselves a bit more."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Adam Garrett-Harris",
      "text": "And I had read it online before, but I got the physical copy this time, and I really enjoyed it. The book is really tiny when you have the physical copy, which is great because you can reference the little sections really easily and you can read it pretty quick. And something about having the physical copy makes it easier to read. I don't know how to explain it, but when you're reading online, it just feels like a really long article, and when you're reading the book, it just feels like a really small book."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Safia Abdalla",
      "text": "I can definitely understand that feeling. I was reading a digital copy and there were definitely times when I was scrolling through the single page view in Preview on mac, and it definitely started to feel like a technical manual."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Jen Luker",
      "text": "I did expect it to be about how to get started in development and how to progress beyond the apprentice process and into more of a leader process. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that as opposed to assumming that everyone is at a different level (junior, mid-level, senior devs), it very much focused on your own journey and your own path. And it gave us a common language, in which to discuss our experiences. So, as we're working together we can talk about those things and understand what we're referring to."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Adam Garrett-Harris",
      "text": "So, here's how the format for the show is going to work. It's a fortnightly podcast, so it's going to come out every 2 weeks on Mondays. First, we'll do a short episode like this one to introduce the book that we'll be reading. And then we'll have a certain number of episodes where we talk about the book a few chapters at a time. And we'll let you know in advance what chapters we're going to be talking about in case you want to read along with us, or if not, that's cool. And then hopefully we will bring the author on to talk about the book in an episode. So we're definitely going to have one of the authors of Apprenticeship Patterns, Dave Hoover, on the show, and we have the author of the next book lined up as well.\n\nNext time we'll talk about chapters 1-2, then 3-4, and then finally 5-7. Then we'll be talking with Dave Hoover.\n\nAnother thing we're doing is a book giveaway. I have 5 copies of Apprenticehip Patterns signed by Dave Hoover, that I'll be giving away to 5 listeners of the show."
