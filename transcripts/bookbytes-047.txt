00:00:15.1 **Speaker 0** Hello and welcome to Book Bytes, a podcast, book club thingy about books. I don't remember what I used to say for this thing. Podcast, book club podcast for developers. I'm Adam and I'm joined by Jason. This week we are talking about thinking and bets by Annie Duke. Jason, you recommended this one. You said you were reading it. Do you want to talk about why?

00:00:43.7 **Speaker 1** Yeah, sure. So I actually started reading this book because I had been doing some interviewing with others at work. And one of the questions that I asked people when interviewing was around books that they had read that they had found valuable in their lives or careers. And this was one of them that came up from somebody as a recommendation. And so I checked it out. And so after hearing a little bit of it, I figured I'd reach out to you and we could talk about it.

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:53.1 **Speaker 0** Yeah, it's been quite a while since we recorded one of these. I started a new job as an iOS developer. And then I just really, really focused on that because I wanted to get really good at that and not have anything else going on. So that's kind of what I've been doing in the meantime. So it's been a year since we had an episode, I think. But technically we recorded seven months before that. That's how long it took me to edit the last one. Hopefully I get this one out sooner.

00:01:54.4 **Speaker 1** Well, we'll see. And I'm looking forward to it because it has been a long time. And even with reading, thinking and bets, I mean, my role has changed from being a just individual contributor engineer into an engineering manager. And so it's like that itself when I figure out how to apply this to career.

00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:19.6 **Speaker 0** Since the last book?

00:02:21.5 **Speaker 1** Probably, yeah. I think it would be since last book. Yeah, it's been a change up for me on that front at least, or at least how I look at it.

00:02:32.8 **Speaker 0** And another cool thing is that I was looking back and I remembered one of the first episodes, the very first book we read was Apprenticeship Patterns. And in episode four of this podcast, because we went through that book in several different episodes, but in episode four, there was a thing in that book called Draw Your Own Map, where you come up with a whole bunch of different possible jobs you could end up in. And I came up with everything from full stack developer to UX designer to mobile developer. And I actually ended up being a mobile developer and I really, really love it.

00:03:17.1 **Speaker 1** It's awesome. I mean, it's cool to see that come to light. And I mean, Apprenticeship Patterns, just touching on that book, it certainly is a book that I refer to others that are looking for some source material. Commonly, it's when people are transitioning and there's the pattern of be the worst and joining a team as the person who's low on the totem pole with the intent of climbing back up.

00:03:45.6 **Speaker 0** Yeah, I definitely was the worst when I joined the team as an iOS developer, even though I had so many years of experience as a developer, I had zero years of experience in iOS. It was a very interesting experience because I was able to bring a lot to the table just from my other experience, but then I had to figure out how to translate that into iOS. And then I had a whole fresh Newick perspective on the code. that other, if you've been doing iOS development your whole career, you would never know certain things or certain patterns.

00:04:24.4 **Speaker 1** Definitely. Like having additional context, being able to go and stack skills, I think that's definitely an important thing. just through careers. We all have backgrounds and different things and applying them to what we're currently working on shapes how we are in our roles. Yep.

00:04:49.3 **Speaker 0** All right. Well, you want to get into this book? I heard about this book on a podcast, so I feel like this book has influenced my thinking for a while, even though I hadn't read it. And so for a while now, I've been thinking things like, you make the best decision with the information that you have, and then you don't regret it later just because you know more. It's like back then you made the best decision that you could. But getting into the book, there's a lot more to it.

00:05:22.8 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And so I mean, just kind of the initial intro of the book I found kind of interesting from Annie Duke was that she talked about her career of initially graduating from a university in psychology, and I think psychology and English, and instead actually went off in the field of playing poker with that being planned initially is like a short stint kind of thing. And it's becoming the direction she went in. And I'm almost led to wonder after having read the book, what was her confidence level of thinking, what percentage do you think she would have planned of having become a poker player instead of, you know, like she majored in English and psychology, winding up in a role that was tightly tied to those

00:06:27.0 **Speaker 0** things. Well, I mean, I think she grew up around a lot of poker. Her brother was a big poker player. I thought you were going to say, what did she think the chances of her book being a national bestseller, which it is.

00:06:44.0 **Speaker 1** Right.

00:06:44.2 **Speaker 0** I mean, she had to do well enough to write it at least, or she wouldn't have written it.

00:06:53.4 **Speaker 1** Right. Yeah.

00:06:55.6 **Speaker 0** And also, can I just say Annie Duke, isn't that like a great name for a poker player?

00:07:00.7 **Speaker 1** Yes. Yes, that is a great name. It sits well if you're on the ESPN poker channel.

00:07:10.2 **Speaker 0** Yep.

00:07:11.0 **Speaker 1** Yeah.

00:07:11.8 **Speaker 0** And also, did this book make you want to play poker?

00:07:17.2 **Speaker 1** It did inspire a bit of that. Like, I haven't found like, you know, I would certainly need to find like a realm of people to go and play it in, because I feel like we're ready to go and do it. You know, if I, you know, grabbed you and grabbed a couple of other people that I don't know about regularly playing, they would kind of be a sad story. in a sense of like, none of us know what we're doing. And so, you know, having a level of guidance, I think would go a long way towards that. Yeah. Having someone experience.

00:07:54.2 **Speaker 0** Well, I haven't really played it much. I think maybe I played it a little bit in high school or something, but Apple has a Texas Hold'em game on the App Store, which is kind of funny. It's kind of a weird looking game. You've got videos of people playing poker that are kind of on the, what's it called? Kind of in the valley of, what's it called? I almost want to say valley of despair. Okay. No, what's it called? It's like, it's like an artificial intelligence. It's almost realistic, but uncanny valley.

00:08:29.9 **Speaker 1** Yes.

00:08:30.5 **Speaker 0** Okay. These videos are kind of an uncanny valley of these poker players that you're playing against. And they're like looking at the cars and pushing their chips onto the table and it looks so fake. But anyway, I played that a little bit and then I taught my son how to play Texas Hold'em and I taught his cousin and I've been the dealer a little bit and I've played, you know, me and my wife and my son. And yeah, it's kind of fun. I win a lot more against my son than I do in that video game.

00:08:58.2 **Speaker 1** Nice team. Yes. Do you maybe have a better read on him?

00:09:03.5 **Speaker 0** Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

00:09:05.6 **Speaker 1** I, you know, when I think of it, I haven't played a lot of poker in my life. But one game that I did play a lot growing up in the Midwest was actually the game of Euchre. And yeah, and I would botch a definition of it. Then it's a game that does kind of have like Trump cards in it and you're trying to win tricks going around. And one of the things with Euchre is that you actually, you play it with four players and you play with the person that is across from you. And you can't tell each other what cards you have. And so there's an element of, you know, you know what other players, like you have a read on what other players might have. But you don't know for sure. And so it's a level of like, do I have confidence that I can do this my own? Do I have confidence that me and the person across from me can do this? So it definitely has similar type of factors of. you have limited information. And, you know, you're using what you have and your confidence in the person that you play with and how the other people around you play to kind of determine how you move forward. So.

00:10:29.5 **Speaker 0** Nice. Yeah. Okay. So in the introduction of this book, a few things I want to point out, it says that a bet is a decision about an uncertain future. I think that's a really cool way of thinking of a bet. And the future is always uncertain. This book talks a lot about embracing uncertainty. And then it also says there are two things that determine how your life will turn out. The quality of your decisions and luck.

00:10:57.8 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And I mean, I think in touching on both of those things, like first, that, you know, the future is always a matter of that or betting. I mean, we're, we're betting that there's a high likelihood that we make it through this podcast, even after all the audio difficulties that we had previously with it. But like, there's still a risk. Like our internet could still go out or my mic could die or many other unforeseen things. But you know, with the information that we have, the I have pretty strong confidence we'll make it.

00:11:36.8 **Speaker 0** Right. Yeah.

00:11:38.9 **Speaker 1** And then, you know, talking about the, the, you know, luck and outcomes, I think. Sorry, like luck and, like, I guess really like luck and skill, like touching, touching on those two things, I think, recognizing that, you know, those two forces are at play and every outcome is, I also put some things in perspective. And I like the example that's, that's given from the Super Bowl game in 2015. Regarding the, you know, Seahawks about to go and potentially, you know, score a touchdown and win and with Pete Carroll making the call to pass instead of handing off to Marshawn Menge. I, I don't recall like lots of Super Bowls, but even I remember, you know, that particular event of like, why did Pete Carroll not choose to run the ball with Marshawn Menge? And just knowing like, he always makes yards, he always pushes it forward. And in reality, you know, like, the only reason I was upset was because the outcome of scoring the touchdown didn't occur. And you know, that, that was the way that everything was pitched.

00:13:12.4 **Speaker 0** The fans would have been totally fine with his decision if it had worked.

00:13:17.6 **Speaker 1** Right. He would have seen like a mastermind.

00:13:21.0 **Speaker 0** Or if it's just an incomplete, cause then the next play he could have it passed off to Marshawn Menge, but instead it was intercepted. And what happened? Did they run it all the way down in score touchdown?

00:13:35.7 **Speaker 1** So, I mean, it was, it was intercepted and at the point that, that they, they intercepted there was no longer a chance for for the Seahawks to, to take it. So because let's see because New England was already up.

00:13:52.5 **Speaker 0** Right. Okay.

00:13:53.2 **Speaker 1** So but with it, yeah, I remember that experience and I liked that example because it's something that stands out so strong. and yet it's a really good example of going in and separating out, you know, what is a good decision compared to what is a good outcome.

00:14:12.4 **Speaker 0** Yeah. And it was really cool that he defended his decision. You know, you can look at the statistics and say, yeah, that was a very good decision. That would, that was a very unlikely outcome.

00:14:23.9 **Speaker 1** Right. Yeah. That's, that's definitely a, like, I mean, the sign of, of an expert, you know, the sign of, of a coach of a, you know, professional sports team being able to say, this, this didn't work out, but like I can see why it didn't work out. And it's not because I made the wrong call, but rather that, you know, a small percentage chance is what occurred here.

00:14:55.1 **Speaker 0** Yeah. One thing this book talks about is that as soon as, even though there's so many possibilities out there, right, there could have been, it could have been complete, could have been incomplete, it could have been an interception, maybe other things I'm not thinking of, I don't know, but it, and each one of those things has a different probability that you can assign to it. But as soon as one of them occurs, it feels like all of the other ones just fall away in a way that they're not going to happen. And of course that's what was always going to happen. And so you say the coach made the wrong call. Well, he wasn't wrong. He made a good bet. He made a bet. Turns out it was a good bet. If you look at the probability at the time.

00:15:37.4 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And I mean, I think I think with it, you know, reflecting on, on like decisions that were you know, myself, like a, what I feel like was a good decision for, for me, but didn't necessarily have the most ideal outcomes is it was probably 10 years ago now I, I made a decision to sell, I had a truck that was was a bit older, and I decided to sell it, and instead go and purchase myself a Subaru Impreza. And with it, while, like, I made the decision because I was starting to commute to work, and the truck was using a lot of gas, the truck was older. And I was like, Okay, I should probably go and upgrade this thing, or like, swap this out before the truck really starts having problems. And before I burn too much money on gas. And so I get a car for it. And that car man, like it, it's a, I went through, I had to get like three air conditioner replacements in it, because they just kept failing. And so, you know, but like, I did it. And it you know, like, I replaced it and it worked out as a car kind of. but ultimately, I felt like, you know, like, I spent a lot on just getting air conditioners replaced on this thing. But when in reality, like the decision itself, though, was like, yeah, like, you needed something like newer needed something that would commute better. But didn't expect to have the problems that came along with it.

00:17:30.7 **Speaker 0** Yeah. Yeah. And you couldn't have known. And right, I'd also say, if you kept the truck, you don't know how that would have turned out either. You don't know if the truck would have suddenly had started having all kinds of problems.

00:17:45.1 **Speaker 1** Exactly.

00:17:46.0 **Speaker 0** All right. I don't really know how to go through the rest of this book, because I felt like I didn't know what the outline of the book was even even after reading through it and taking notes. Because the the titles of the chapters and different sections, they don't really give you an outline of like, okay, here's the strategies. Here's the sub strategies.

00:18:07.6 **Speaker 1** Here's on it. And that, you know, it wasn't necessarily like a, a complete buildup of things. I think, I think for me going through this, I got probably the the strongest key points from the early sections of the book. And in particular, you know, going and first separating the, the results from or sorry, separating the decisions from the outcomes. Yeah. And, and then, you know, along with that is, you know, it touched on like hindsight bias. And so, yeah, I mean, you brought that up specifically of, of, you know, in the face of my my car having problems, like, it's, it also wasn't necessarily meant to be that my car would have problems like. that was not not a guarantee.

00:19:10.6 **Speaker 0** Right. So real quick, hindsight bias is the tendency after an outcome is known to see the outcome as having been inevitable.

00:19:19.7 **Speaker 1** Yes. And Annie gives the example in the book around talking about a poker match live where like, players have put in, they've both gone all in, and the cards are on the table. And so she'll say, like, the percentage is this, you know, to say that there's a 25% chance for this thing to happen. And then it happened, or there was a 17% chance for this thing to happen. And it happened. And people, you know, first, somebody was shocked by it. But then they were excited because they saw that 17% still means it's possible.

00:19:53.5 **Speaker 0** So you're saying there's a chance.

00:19:56.4 **Speaker 1** Right. There's, there's a chance. And I mean, I think probably one of the biggest percentages in the book that stood out to me was talking about a, you know, a professional poker player, like that, you know, while they may have more skill, ultimately, you know, they're probably, they're still losing 40% of the time. And that that seems like a lot of loss to have to deal with, or like be comfortable with. And I know that, yeah, like, this is happening a lot. But getting used to what 40% feels like also makes it, you know, improves that relationship. It doesn't mean 60% is guaranteed every time because it's not 60%.

00:20:44.1 **Speaker 0** So yeah.

00:20:46.2 **Speaker 1** So I think, I think that that was one thing that stood out to me. And, and then, you know, going and talking about like the increase of information as well. And I think that was in the poker versus chess section.

00:21:02.4 **Speaker 0** Yeah.

00:21:03.2 **Speaker 1** And it gives the comparison between poker and chess, chess being you have all of the information in front in front of you. Like you, you can see the chess board, your opponent can see the chess board. And if you play in a particular way, you know, putting out all of like, moving away all of your, you know, say your opponent's tendencies, then like, you have everything that's going on there. And you can, you know, given enough time, you can make the perfect move, right? Right. Whereas in, in the case of poker, like you don't have that, like that you have information that's in front of you in your hand. And, you know, I guess, if you are taking into account your your other players, like you, you know, you have maybe an idea of what their tendency may be. But then you also have a strong factor of luck in a deck of cards that's been shuffled. And, and, you know, I also liked in that, that, that, you know, she called out specifically, John von Neumann as well. I don't know if that that popped to you at all.

00:22:18.6 **Speaker 0** It did. Yeah. That that stuck right out to me was he mentioned in a beautiful mind because he, he was mentored by John Nash. And let's see, he, what did he, he worked on nuclear weapons, right? But he also came up with game theory.

00:22:36.4 **Speaker 1** He came up with game theory and, and also the modern computer architecture that we have. So he was a topic inside of the imposter's handbook. So the Oregon organization of computers where we have like CPUs for processing and, and memory for like short term ephemeral storage and then disk for like long term durable storage. Like that was a creation of von Neumann. So like to hear that I was like, some, some people just like the way that they they're so connected to so many things.

00:23:16.0 **Speaker 0** I thought it was really cool that he, he was mentored by John Nash from a beautiful mind. And I know John Nash from that movie was really into game theory.

00:23:25.2 **Speaker 1** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you want, you want to talk a little bit about game theory?

00:23:30.5 **Speaker 0** Yeah, well, it's the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between people, between different intelligent, rational decision makers. And I, I love the example in this book from a print, the princess bride, where it's a, it's a like a dual, but it's a dual of wits where he, uh, he has two, he has two drinks. He puts them beneath the table and said he, he, uh, he empties out some poison and he puts the two cups in front of them and he says, all right, um, either you can drink the cup that's in front of you or you can swap it. And then we, and then we both drink. So either we both drink or you swap it and we both drink. And he goes back and forth with all these possible different decisions. Do you think I'm, would, would you put the poison in front of me and blah, blah, blah. And he goes, he, he basically can't, can't decide what to do. And so he just points, Hey, look at that, swaps the cups. And then he says, okay, I think we should just drink the cup in front of us. And so then the other guy, he's like, all right, she starts drinking. And then he felt very confident that he could drink the poison. If the other guy thought this would have been a lot easier if I'd used names, the names of people.

00:25:05.9 **Speaker 1** Yeah.

00:25:06.6 **Speaker 0** But anyway, he, he thought he became very, very confident that he could drink the cups since the other person thought he had not switched it. And he was confidently drinking the drink. So he drinks it in any, any dies. And the point was he didn't have all the information because they were both poisoned. And the other guy had just built up an immunity to the poison. So that was just a very funny version of game theory. I think a more simple example would be something like winning or losing something, but depending on the other people's decision that can affect it. Do you have a good example? I don't have a good example right off of the cuff, but I think one example might be, there, there is a thousand dollars and two people. you can choose to take the money. But if you both choose to take the money, neither of you get it. Something like that. Right?

00:26:13.7 **Speaker 1** So, so like, the smart decision.

00:26:16.6 **Speaker 0** What?

00:26:17.5 **Speaker 1** Like the prisoner's dilemma?

00:26:20.3 **Speaker 0** The prisoner's dilemma. Yeah. That's one of them.

00:26:23.5 **Speaker 1** Okay. I don't, yeah. I don't want to interrupt you. if you were considering.

00:26:28.1 **Speaker 0** I was just going to say the smart decision in that case would be to, for one of you, one of you to choose to take the money and then you could split it later. But if, cause if neither of you chooses it, nobody gets the money. And if both of you choose it, none, none of you get the money. But if the other person chooses it and you don't, there's no guaranteeing that they're actually going to split it with you later.

00:26:51.7 **Speaker 1** And then there's scaling that scenario too, outside of, you know, from two to three, and beyond two when it's, I mean, it's still the same problem at heart, but you know, the difficulty of getting, getting those that many things in play are in place.

00:27:12.0 **Speaker 0** But I mean that's all very theoretical. I think in general, what she's saying is life is like poker because it's so uncertain and life is like game theory because you're in conflict and cooperation with other intelligent beings all the time with an uncertain future. And you're always constantly having to make decisions about the future and what other decisions, and what decisions other people are going to make as well.

00:27:38.9 **Speaker 1** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, she makes the, you know, the point of, you know, starting with the, about spending a month in Des Moines and, and how there was like a gambler that took a bet to go and live in Des Moines for a month.

00:28:01.3 **Speaker 0** Yep.

00:28:02.5 **Speaker 1** Like within like a single, you know, single street. And, and how, you know, he thought he could do it for 30 grand, like taking a bet for 30 grand, and then realize that, you know, after weighing everything out and finally getting there, realizing that he could not continue to deal with it. And, you know, she makes the point of like, while, you know, we often don't have a $30,000 bet that we're going to live somewhere for a month, we do, you know, we do have decisions that we make that there's a lot of things to factor in, like, you know, will I meet someone significant, you know, going to said place or like, if you're changing jobs, you know, if you're changing jobs, like, what are all the impacts that are involved in that? I mean, you talk about going and, you know, becoming a mobile developer, like, you know, all the factors that equate in that of like, you know, I'm departing from all of this, all of these comforts that I have of an area that I know, and moving to this place that I know that I'm not as strong, like, is that going to be like, is that going to hurt me? Or is it going to help me? Is it gonna, you know, is it going to pay more? Is it going to pay a lot more? Is it going to pay less? But is that, you know, is something I can make up for it? Like all of those types of decisions.

00:29:26.8 **Speaker 0** Is it going to be more fulfilling? Yeah. Is there a chance that, you know, as an iOS developer, a lot of my career is decided by, can be impacted by the decisions of one company, Apple, you know, they can make decisions that drastically affect my career now. And that's not something that can happen in the web.

00:29:52.2 **Speaker 1** I mean, other than, I think Google controls Chrome. So there's that. But yes, I mean, certainly, like, yeah, so, which I think, you know, brings that story back to home, like, while this, you know, the story itself is interesting and attention getting, I mean, that is, that is the sort of thing that, that we deal with. And then, but also in the face of it, it takes it and says, like, while there are unknowns that factor in into things, we also have the ability to go and grow our confidence by getting information. Like, you know, if your concern happens to be around, you know, like, if it's Valerie, there are sources that you can find some stuff about that. If it's around, you know, Apple going and, you know, wrecking your career by a move that they make, you can also look at, you know, historical cases in which they have or have not done something like that.

00:31:05.3 **Speaker 0** And yeah, I'm making a bet on they're not going to want to do that because they want to continue to sell a iPhones and that my career is pretty safe because they've sold a lot of iPhones. Right. And, you know, even if they decide to make some other device in the future that completely cannibalizes iPhone sales, I can easily switch over to developing for that instead.

00:31:34.4 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And then there's also the factor as well is that, you know, making a choice like that is not truly zero sum. While poker itself is in the fact that there's only so much money that exists on the table, right? Yeah. And, you know, so many chips, whereas like, even if you were to go and get experience and, you know, being a mobile developer and then all of a sudden stop doing that for whatever reason, it doesn't pan out. It doesn't give you fulfillment anymore because Apple changes, you know, they depart from using Swift to using something really arcane. Then even still, you actually do have things that you have gained from that as well. Just, you know, the net outcome of whether it be network, whether it be, you know, your ability to work on, you know, a mobile device, you know, maybe you're like, okay, well, I'll just switch over to a mobile device. And that's the other thing too, is that all of our decisions are not necessarily zero sum either. Like there can be something to gain, be gained in, you know, this decisions that we make often. Yeah.

00:32:56.4 **Speaker 0** So one thing I like in that chapter, chapter two, I want to bet is how we form beliefs. She says that we think we form our beliefs by hearing something, finding out if it's true. And then if we think it's true, then bam, we form a new belief. But actually we hear something, we believe it by default. And maybe later sometime in the future, if we have the time or inclination, we think, huh, is that really true? And we look it up and determine if it's actually true or not. I mean, we don't have time to vet everything that we hear. It's efficiency. And I think it goes back to in the first chapter, it's talking about how our brains evolved, because we want certainty and order, and we're kind of uncomfortable with the idea of luck playing a significant role in our lives. We want to think we have control of our future and that everything is based on our own skill. And then out in nature, in order to keep us safe, we're okay with false positives. Like, oh, I think I heard a tiger. Okay, nevermind, it's not a tiger. It was just the wind. That's a false positive. That's okay. It's not going to kill you. But a false negative, if it actually was a tiger and you didn't hear it, that could kill you. So we seek certainty and look for connections, even if they're kind of dubious or they don't exist. And she talks a lot in this book about how we have to figure out how to work with our brains, work with the brains that we have, because we can't really change it. And it's going to be an uphill battle if we're trying to change the way our brains work instead of just working with them.

00:35:01.2 **Speaker 1** Yeah. I think, I mean, touching on that, like, I mean, we're working with them. But also, I think, when you talk about we believe things quickly, you know, first on a first approach of them, I mean, there's a level of trust that that we we form with our sources of information as well. Like, I mean, we're, we're either got them that I wasn't unsure of, then I would be pretty quick to go and assume that you're telling me something that is true and right. And I also know that that's actually one of the concerns that has emerged now with generative AI. Like, that's a new thing since we've last talked. They're like a new thing at least getting hype right now. Yeah. And, you know, with its ability to go and hallucinate things that didn't actually occur, you know, our if our instinct is to go and trust the things that we read, I mean, like, wow, you know, we've long been told, like, don't trust everything that you see online. You know, if it seems like it's coming from computer from source of knowledge, like, the instinct can be like, yeah, that, that thing is true. I mean, there's the, I think there one article that got a lot of headlines was the idea of like, a lawyer who went and asked chat GPT, you know, tell me some cases that are similar to this one and how they turned out. And it was a bunch of fabricated ones used as, as, as evidence for a case and it was, you know, like, that sort of thing is, is what we're at risk of. when, when we see things that are that are generated that look, look and sound like really authoritative, you know? Yeah. Like, if there's, if there's an essay written about something that, you know, sounds like it happened, and, and we don't have the source to go and, and validate against that, then, you know, certainly like, I, I would believe that, you know, Thomas Jefferson sailed across, you know, sailed across the ocean and through the Mediterranean, like if, you know, it sounds good enough, like, sure, why not?

00:37:25.7 **Speaker 0** Yeah, of course, there's, there's confirmation bias as well. So if it's, it's something that you're already likely to believe, then, hey, yeah, that fits, fits in with my worldview. But if it's something that doesn't fit in with your worldview, you're, you're, you may just reject it and not look it up either.

00:37:48.6 **Speaker 1** Annie talks about that from social media and, and that being a case where it gets amplified as well of, you know, the, the things that you like, or the things you engage in are the things that you see more of because of algorithms driving for that.

00:38:06.3 **Speaker 0** And so, Oh yeah. I mean, there used to be this thing, I mean, I guess there's, it still is a thing like pink car syndrome or a phenomenon where, you know, you become aware of Subarus because you're thinking about buying a Subaru and all of a sudden you start seeing them everywhere. And that's just because they're always there, but there's so much information in the world that you can't pay attention to at all. But now that you're thinking about Subaru is it seems significant. And so it seems like something about the world has changed, but the world hasn't changed. Your brain has changed and you're just noticing it because it seems significant now. But what you're saying is there's also algorithms that are throwing more stuff in our face. If we, if they think we're interested in it.

00:38:52.9 **Speaker 1** Right. Yeah. Like if you're, if you're interacting with more posts that have pink cars in them then, and like, and those like, you may actually see more pink cars in your day. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, that, that is the thing. And, you know, like stepping back and recognizing that, that we, that we do those things and you know, using that as well, like while it sounds like detrimental in some ways, it's also like our ability to go and train our, our, I think she talks about the type one brain and type two brain from, is it thinking fast and slow? Yeah.

00:39:41.5 **Speaker 0** Daniel Kahneman.

00:39:44.1 **Speaker 1** And and so from that though, like, you know, our ability to, you know, think in and reason about things is also something that we can train ourselves to have more, you know, like be more reflexive on like, I mean, the classic example is like of driving, right? Like where, you know, when, when I was first a student driver and learning to drive, lots of attention to be paying to everything down to like the, I am pushing the turning turn signal. And now it's, it's far more just like a, I do this thing, you know? And and so like, that's actually like a net benefit for us is like to get, to get the right, right reflexes built in. Then it gives us the ability to focus on, on the other things.

00:40:36.6 **Speaker 0** Yeah. And chapter two, one strategy that she brings up is saying, want to bet or having, having a group of people that kind of all help, help each other think in bets. And so anytime someone says something, well, first actually one strategy is to express your uncertainty in your beliefs by saying something like, you know, I'm 60% sure that Citizen Kane won best picture instead of just saying Citizen Kane won best picture. Because then you're, you're expressing, there's some amount of uncertainty, even if you're pretty certain. And if you're wrong, it doesn't feel as bad. And then the other thing is saying, want to bet. So whenever someone says, want to bet, you immediately start asking your ques, yourself questions like, oh, how, how sure am I about this? Where did I learn it from? And all sorts of things like that.

00:41:36.4 **Speaker 1** I actually had an experience like that recently, or something that I thought about after having read the book with software. And, you know, we had a release date that was, that was raised because of external factors. And, you know, the question was, are we going to make it? And, you know, commonly, you know, with estimates, it's either like you make the estimate, or you miss the deadline, you know, black or white. But, you know, shaping it in a way where, I mean, I didn't actually say it out loud of, I'm 60% confident that they will make this date. It's something that that I thought in my own head. And, and actually kind of made me wish that that was, that was more common for us to do, because then it's allowing us to be a little bit more analytical about where are the cases where we have unknowns, because unknowns for me, in when I'm making an estimate in software are often things where I, you know, in the interest of not being incorrect, I will opt to pad my days and say, oh, well, I don't know on how long that thing is going to take. So I better give myself at least, you know, another another week or two of time on it, because I need just general time to understand what I'm working with. But moving to a model where we say things like, oh, well, I'm 60% confident on this, on this thing, that we'll get it by this date. And you know, what would make me more confident that we'll hit this date is if we go and remove this thing from scope, or if we, you know, if we have somebody else who's also working on this thing, like that will, that will boost it.

00:43:24.2 **Speaker 0** And it reminds me of a strategy. I think it's actually pretty common in software development, a strategy that's mentioned in the last chapter of this book called pre-mortems. And it's where you pretend like you're in the future. And you didn't, you didn't make the deadline or whatever negative outcome you want to talk about. You pretend you're like you're in the future and that negative outcome occurred. And then you explain how you got there. What are all the things that went wrong? So I'd heard of that. I hadn't heard of the, the other strategy that kind of goes along with it called back casting. And it's where you imagine you've already achieved the positive outcome and think about how you got there. So I think it could be interesting in a software development project to do a pre-mortem and to do back casting.

00:44:19.1 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And I, I've done a little bit of, of the back casting. actually while, while working, while in the management role, talking with, talking with the product team and design team and saying, okay, let's look at, you know, a theoretical thing two years from now and say, you know, what's the story that, that we want. And, you know, we, you know, we want some person to have, you know, X level of success, right. And then yeah, going and saying, how did they, how did they do that? Like, you know, how did the user have success doing this thing? And it's, well, they, you know, they did this and they did this. And then saying, you know, walking all the way back and saying, wait, we're not going to have that in two years. Like either, you know, either saying it, we want that and saying, you know, that's not realistic. And even altering that story, it's been, it's been something I've done just a little bit of, and I think has helped in the planning process of, of not saying, you know, not just looking at it from the current rate where we're at right now and saying, well, you know, what are the next three main features we're working on? But instead taking the further, further leap and walking back to go and inform us on that roadmap.

00:45:49.7 **Speaker 0** Um, you want to talk about chapter three? Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's called bet to learn. I don't really know how that applies to the chapter, but she, she talked about this, this story about this guy named Nick who always, Nick played poker with her and he always stuck with the same predictable strategy and he told everyone his strategy and he also lost all the time and then blamed bad luck. And so the idea is that, you know, experience is a good teacher and experience is necessary, but it's not enough to become an expert because not everyone listens to their teachers. So she talks about a learning loop where you have, um, I have to zoom in on this. Okay. The learning loop is where you have a belief and then you make a bet and then you have an outcome based on what you've learned from that belief, bet and outcome. Maybe you adjust your belief or whatever. you learn something, you get new skills and you make another bet and just continues in a learning loop. But also there's luck. And so that can really kind of throw your learning loop off. And, uh, I'm not exactly sure what you said about the learning loop when, when luck is involved. Do you, do you know, I mean, I think you just have to decide like, was the outcome because of luck or skill? I think if it, the, if the outcome was because of luck, you kind of just throw that away and you don't learn from that because that was just, that was just luck. But if it was based on skill, then you, you reincorporate that into your beliefs. Does that sound about right?

00:47:51.1 **Speaker 1** Yeah. Yeah. That's, I mean, that's the, my, you throw it out or, uh, I mean, and I suppose it leads to like separating out, you know, teasing those things apart as well, to say that, you know, that, that outcome itself was a, a factor of luck. What does that, I mean, potentially what does that look like? And still going and taking the decision factor in like, like how, how solid of a decision was it even outside of, you know, what the outcome was? I don't know if it's in this chapter or a little later where she actually brings up, um, the talking with other players about poker hands and, um, what they, what they chose to do, having people stop short of, of actually what the outcome was, because then it speaks to, um, you know, before, you know, determining, you know, whether somebody's decision was, was good or not. just saying like, okay, well you have these, you know, these three cards in hand, like, did you make a good choice here or not? is, is separate from the actual outcome itself. So, um, that was, that was like a strategy she talked about was like, if you, if you remove the outcome from it, then you'll be more objective about the, your decisions to make any move.

00:49:25.8 **Speaker 0** Um, and another cool thing in this chapter was, uh, it was the idea of self-serving bias, where if you have a positive outcome, then you attribute it to your own skill. But if you have a negative outcome, you attribute it to bad luck. And then we do the opposite, or we tend to do the opposite with others. We attribute their success to luck. And so actually, I don't know what I was gonna say about that. That's just very, very interesting. Um, I think we're not really learning from it. if we're, if we're viewing everything that way.

00:50:00.3 **Speaker 1** Yeah. And it, it dooms us to be, uh, Nick, where we are continually pushing away, you know, the teacher of, of outcomes. Like, if, uh, you know, like, if you keep, keep saying that I'm, you know, I'm not the problem, or like the things that I have control of are not causing this, but rather it's, it's things external then, um, and not learning from others saying like, where they actually, they made a good move regardless of what outcome they received. Um, yeah, then we're throwing a whole lot away.

00:50:43.9 **Speaker 0** And then there's this part where I think this is a really, really cool, really key idea that I got from this book where she, she goes and she talks about habits and basically she says, go, go read the power of habit by Charles Duhigg. I think there's basically a cue, a routine and a reward. So we're, we're built for that cue routine reward, and we're also built for competition. And so that's, that's kind of why we, we want to win. And so we're going to attribute our good luck to skill. I mean, our good outcomes to skill and our bad outcomes to luck, but she, she talks about kind of changing that, that habit loop to where you don't have to give up the reward. You just change how you're comparing yourself to others. So you can be a better credit giver or more willing to admit mistakes, or you could reward yourself by trying to be the most willing to explore possible reasons for an outcome with an open mind, even, or even especially if it casts a bad light on you. And so even if you're not doing well by the standard measures, you can be really exceptional that way by being really willing to admit mistakes. And then you're going to learn a lot better that way and get better.

00:52:19.6 **Speaker 1** Thanks for pointing that out, putting that takeaway out because I mean, it's, I think being willing to admit mistakes is also something that's, that's valuable. Like, I mean, in, in your career, like as, even as like someone who is more experienced, like as you become more senior and, you know, have more mentoring opportunities, it can be very easy to go and project your career on others, even if you're sharing advice to them and saying, well, if you just do what I did, then you'll become just like me, or you'll become, you know, you'll level up to my level. But I think, you know, but, but also to stop and say, actually, you know, I made this choice and it wasn't like, I made this choice and, you know, like, it wasn't, you know, the, the right thing, or maybe whether or not it wasn't the right thing or be like, but I made this choice and it, it was a decision that was made, you know, without paying attention to, you know, what all the information was in front of me. And instead, you know, the outcome went this way or the other.

00:53:45.9 **Speaker 0** And I think as you move into management, being a better credit giver can be really important because, you know, like I agree with that. You don't want to be taking credit for other, other people have done as a manager. You need to be very good at pointing out what other, other people have done.

00:54:08.3 **Speaker 1** well. Yeah. I think, I think that that is, is very important for a number of reasons. And I, you know, I guess as a manager, that is something that I strive to make sure happens and not say like, especially anytime that my team is involved in something to say I did something is definitely, that is the wrong play. And, and rather, you know, calling out particular individuals, because not, not only, you know, can you, like others have so much to gain from you doing that as a manager. I think, I think that that, that is the thing is like, if or like you as a manager, you as a, as a senior is just, you know, if you're giving shout outs about some, someone who's new in their career and is just doing excellent things, like that's, that's a big deal for them. Like that's, that's setting, you know, like trajectory type, type things for, for them potentially, but by doing it, not, not being like, not making things up, but, but rather just being like, yeah, like these are the skills that this person has like that, or like, you know, this is a success that this person had because they, they made a really good choice because they, because they were very analytical about something like whatever it may be, like, you know, when, when you have an opportunity to have someone be able to level up like that, like it's a really big deal. And so like, if you are, if you're doing that as a manager, as a senior leader, like I mean, it's great for both you and them because it's boosting their morale and their potential and you know, leading to greater success in your team.

00:56:11.7 **Speaker 0** So I don't have much. in chapter four, the buddy system, it really just talks about having a group of people to hold each other accountable. And, and that diversity is important if you're.

00:56:27.0 **Speaker 1** And so, you know, I think that's a really important part of it. And yeah, we touched, we touched on, you know, the diversity side a bit, like staying out of strict reinforcement loops of, of your, of your biases like, and, and then yeah, having the group really for, for the case of, you know, being able to have yourself like, get called out, not by yourself, but, you know, getting feedback from others. And I think there, there are a lot of ways to go and get that whether it be through, you know, if, if it's in your, your working career, you know, getting feedback from peers, from mentors, managers, so forth of saying like, you know, like, I did this thing, give me feedback on it. If it's, if you have a significant other getting it from them, you've got friends like getting it from them, like that, that you're able to be kind of on that level of, of having candor like that, then definitely do that. And, and it will, it will help you catch the things where you have blind spots. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. That's, that's what I have for, for that.

00:57:41.5 **Speaker 0** And then chapter five is called descent to win. And it just talks about approaching things with skepticism. One thing I liked was that she said, instead of saying, I agree with you, she said, she said to say, I agree with you. and instead of, I, I agree with you, but because if you say I agree with you, but it means you don't really agree with them.

00:58:05.4 **Speaker 1** Yeah, that's, I mean, that is definitely something that is important to put, you know, when, when you're, when you're communicating, like watching certain, certain words that can be dismissive of what other people are saying. It's similar to when I've caught myself doing this in the past with sending messages and pull request, code reviews and saying, just do this.

00:58:39.0 **Speaker 0** Oh, I, I, I really avoid using the word just because it, it implies that the solution is simple and that maybe they're stupid for not doing that. And if they find it hard that they're stupid.

00:58:54.2 **Speaker 1** Right. And similarly to say you could do that, but if you do this instead, that's saying do this instead. Like if you, if you, if you get rid of everything before the, but that's really what you're saying.

00:59:11.2 **Speaker 0** That's really what the word, but means is that you're negating everything you just said. I like the idea of saying, and instead of button, I try to do that a lot, a lot now because it's, um, I did, I did this type of, uh, therapy called dbt. it's dialectical behavior therapy. And the idea is that a dialectical thought is to maybe seemingly, uh, two statements that are seemingly at odds. Like, you know, I'm, I'm sad that something, and I'm glad that something else, you know, you can be glad and sad at the same time. So you can say, I agree with you and something else. It, it, they don't have to be at odds.

01:00:04.4 **Speaker 1** I know I was working with someone or I had, I had someone on my team that I was talking to recently and they were switching over to another team. And to say that they were sad and glad was definitely that, that situation of they were, they were sad to be leaving those that they had been working with previously. And yet they were very excited about the prospects that were ahead of them with their, their new position. And, and yeah. Um, it's not, it's not refuting the fact that, that they, they have sadness. They're not saying I'm sad, but this is going to be great. It's both. Yeah.

01:00:47.7 **Speaker 0** Okay. And then the final chapter is adventures in mental time travel. We've already talked about back casting and pre-mortems. Um, another, another idea in there is temporal discounting where it's a tendency to use the resources we have now, instead of saving it for a future version of ourselves. And she talks about this Seinfeld skit where he's, uh, he's doing a standard routine and he's talking about night Jerry night. Jerry always wants to stay up late because he wants to, and he's not thinking about how it's going to affect morning Jerry, who's going to wake up exhausted and have to go to work. I actually went and watched it. It's pretty funny. Yeah.

01:01:34.7 **Speaker 1** I'll have to go and find the clip or she's fair with me, but like, I definitely, I get the sense of it. And I think Seinfeld is definitely a show in which I did not understand it so much as when I, when I was young, but to watch it now and to say this is people like this, this is us.

01:01:59.2 **Speaker 0** Yeah. I loved it when I was a kid. Yeah.

01:02:03.6 **Speaker 1** I didn't follow it quite, quite as well when I was a kid, but to see that, yeah.

01:02:08.1 **Speaker 0** I mean, there were certain episodes I wasn't allowed to watch, but yeah, it's pretty good. Um, yeah. I mean this chapter, it talks about like how, how can we recruit past or future serve versions of ourselves to be our decision buddies. And so the back casting and pre-mortems, those are two different versions of our future selves that we can bring in to say like, Hey, future version that had a successful outcome. How'd you do it? Future version of myself that had a bad outcome. Like what happened? What, what, what went wrong? So yeah, that's pretty cool. Then another technique is 10, 10, 10 questions by Susie Welch. And you just ask yourself, what are the consequences of each of my options? Uh, what were the consequences in 10 minutes and 10 months and in 10 years, or, uh, how would I feel, how would I, you could do the, go back in time and say, how would I feel today if I made this decision 10 minutes ago, 10 months ago or 10 years ago? So I thought that was pretty cool. And then another cool thing is that we overestimate the impact of an individual moment on our overall happiness. So kind of in the moment, a certain, a certain decision or like a certain thing that's happening right now, it may feel like a really big deal, but it might not even be a big deal in 10 minutes. Probably not in 10 months, definitely not in 10 years.

01:03:44.6 **Speaker 1** I, I can certainly tell you like, like on, on that is, um, you know, have you ever debated about, you know, purchasing something online where, you know, maybe you have a couple of options and you waffle back and forth between them and you're like, well, this one's got a better price, but you know, this one has better specs. Like, like you go back and forth and then, you know, you also let me ultimately make the call and get the thing and it's, you know, you enjoy it, but it's also like you said, inconsequential to like the longterm, you know, your, your life most likely. Yeah.

01:04:27.6 **Speaker 0** You're probably not thinking, oh wow, I really wish I'd gotten the version that had, I don't know. You probably don't even know. You know, 10 months down the road, you probably don't even know what features you're missing because it's, it's fine. Whatever you got, it's fine. I've also heard one time that people, if you're making a small purchase, people are happier if they take a little bit longer to think about it. But if you're making a big purchase, people are happier if you don't take as long to think about it. Now I'm not citing that or anything. Do you, believe me?

01:05:02.7 **Speaker 1** I mean, I would, I would agree on the big purchase. I suppose it comes with the nature of it too. Sometimes, like, I mean, if, if a big purchase is also inclusive of, you know, to the extent of say like a home where you're relocating yourself, like that's, that's big outside the scope of just like a monetary concern. So I think that there's, there's a level of time to be weighed into that. So you're not, you know, up and, you know, you're not uprooting yourself in a way that could, or should be thought for you a bit more.

01:05:50.3 **Speaker 0** I don't know. I felt like, I kind of felt like this is true for me because when I'm making a big purchase, it's, it's usually pretty clear that it's, it's going to be something I'll enjoy if it's quality or not. And I don't want to beat myself up for spending so much money. It doesn't. ultimately, you know, if I have the money for it, if I'm going to enjoy it, then yeah, why not buy it? I think I used to, I used to him and about it and then feel bad because I spent so much money and that doesn't matter if I'm going to enjoy it and I could afford it. Right.

01:06:28.4 **Speaker 1** I mean, that's, that's your, that's your bet right there, right? Well, if you, you know, you've got, you got 80% confidence that, you know, this is going to give you satisfaction or exactly. Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, okay. Adam, I guess one question is, uh, you know, what, uh, what level of confidence do you have that, uh, you're going to recommend this book to somebody else in the next month?

01:06:58.1 **Speaker 0** Next month? Yeah, probably 80%, 80% confident. If someone asked me, if I recommend it, then it's a hundred percent. Yeah. It's not one of those books where it's like, oh, this is for a certain kind person. No, like really this is, this is a book for anyone. I think everyone should read it or at least, you know, know some of the ideas from it.

01:07:21.9 **Speaker 1** Yeah. I think certainly knowing the ideas from it, it's, it's already a thing that I have, I've shared with others, like some of the ideas from it. And, uh, I think likely I would sit in, in, uh, that, that good 80, 90% realm. I think, I think honestly also after, um, us going and recording it, I'm even more, uh, more confident just by nature of now I have a reinforcing factor of not only did, um, you know, not only did I read this book and think you should find something interesting, that you could find something interesting in it, but also that I recorded it. And so it, it's meaningful to me through that as well. Yeah.

01:08:12.2 **Speaker 0** All right. Yeah. Do you have any final thoughts?

01:08:16.9 **Speaker 1** Uh, I mean, it was, it was, uh, good, good to run through it. I'm, I'm glad you could, you could join me in and recording and talking about it.

01:08:26.9 **Speaker 0** And, um, yeah, I'm glad you recommended it. I've, I've wanted to read this book for awhile, so I'm glad I have. Okay. Well, I don't know. We don't have another book lined up and I don't know what our plans are, but I'm glad that we recorded this episode. So, uh, yeah, just, uh, you know, stay tuned. Probably not going to read code. Like we said, we were because that book is hard to read.

01:08:54.4 **Speaker 1** It's good, but it's hard. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah.

01:08:59.2 **Speaker 0** I definitely enjoyed the first 30 pages, but I have like 10% confidence. I'll finish it in my lifetime.

01:09:09.6 **Speaker 1** Yeah. I, I, I still, I still have it, but I would, I would put it probably even a little bit less. so I put it close to 5% because I still have the book that may slip down if I didn't physically own it.

01:09:24.6 **Speaker 0** All right. Well, I'll see. Talk to you next time later.

01:09:28.2 **Speaker 1** All right. Later, Adam.
