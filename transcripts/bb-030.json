Anyway, so, point being I’ve read Chapter One so most of mine is going to be sharing my favorite stories and listening to the stories that you share and asking lots and lots of questions; and I want to slightly, partially disagree with you that it’s not applicable to you even as a non-manager because oftentimes the managers learn how to be managers from the people they manage. So what you learn in this book doesn’t just teach you how to be a manager, it teaches you how to be a good member of a team."

And my supervisor had been there for years before me and he told me about stories where he cried.

You need to step up.” And that’s not usually something that I’m prone to do. I tend to be very, very conflict avoidant."

One of the things he said is he declared a safe space and it sounds silly when you say it that way, but it’s genuinely what he did. He just kind of, sat us in the office and said, “Look, this is a safe space. I’m going to say things, you’re going to say things, some of these things may hurt, but they don’t have to hurt. This is the place where we are going to set ourselves aside and look at situations objectively and see what we can do to handle them better next time. We’re going to look at them and pick them apart and figure out how we were supposed to experience them.” 0:13:18.9 And that changed… a lot about how I looked at difficult conversations, and crucial conversations, as I mention that book a lot, and… In this sense, you know, radical candor, being able to sit down with someone and tell them the hard truth, but be able to do it in a way that says, “This is a safe space. We need to step back from ourselves and look at something that happened.”"
