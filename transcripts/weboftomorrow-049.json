So, the interesting thing that I took from that is that accessibility has less to do with the disability, and more to do with the tools that make you disabled. So, for instance, if you’re in a wheelchair and you go into a building that does not have an elevator, but does have stairs, you are very clearly disabled in this building; but, if you go into that same building and it now has an elevator, you can get to the 3rd floor, then you are no longer disabled."

It’s used a lot for the web, there are multiple screen readers that are all used and it’s kind of like browsers in that none of them are exactly the same. The technologies that are implemented are also not exactly the same. So, we are kind of dealing with like, a browser conflict, just like we’re dealing with a screen reader conflict when we’re trying to code things for the web, but they are essentially screen readers."

They’re so bad. (laughs) And then you have other ones that, you know, accessibility has been taken into account but they’re not quite perfect, and you can pretty much do what you want. It can be a little awkward and it can be a little janky, but it still works. And then you’ve got other ones that have really spent the time, and invested in taking that into consideration, how you move around a website, whether you use only a keyboard, whether you use a mouse, you can still use a mouse with a screen reader just fine, but it changes how you can interact with the web, by a lot."

      "text": "Ooh, all sorts. So, I like to say that there’s 3 different major types of conditions. You’ve got your permanent disabilities, you have your temporary disabilities, and you have your circumstantial disabilities. So, the permanent disabilities are the things like, you know, vision acuity issues. Not just blindness, but poor vision, or cataracts, or color blindness of one sense or another. There’s a lot of different types of visual issues. You also have audio issues where, you know, you’re deaf, or hard of hearing. You have limb issues, broken or missing limbs. So, if you don’t have an arm, then it makes using a mouse much more difficult, or even a keyboard much more difficult. If you are, you know, paralyzed you have the same issues. So, there’s those to take into account, and then you have temporary disabilities where you have some sort of disability, but you’ll heal from it. It’s not a long-term condition. A broken arm, for instance, or your eyes have been dilated, or you lost your glasses, you know? Something to that effect, and then you also have circumstantial disabilities, such as deafness because you’re in a loud room, or you’re holding a sleeping infant."

You know? You’re going to either, figure out how to use your other hand to use your mouse, or you’re going to use only a keyboard; and that type of limited disability, regardless of whether it’s permanent, temporary, or circumstantial, is going to affect your ability to interact with the web based on how good of a job that website did on working with accessibility options."

You know, there’s also other things like ADHD. If it’s really large blocks of text, the chances of someone hanging on that long is very, very unlikely.

These test for ARIA labels and they test for like, alt tags, and various other technological ways in which you can try to encourage screen readers to be able to navigate through your site, but this is only about, approximately, an average of 30% of the problems that you can find on the web, but those are a lot of the low-hanging fruit.

So, when it comes to accessibility, that means that we are looking to convince our companies to utilize those technologies as well. Some of the complaints against using them is that, “Well, you know, it takes a lot of time” or, “We don't really know where to get started” or, “There’s just too much and we can’t deal with it right now when we have all of these other features that are client facing and financially profitable; where accessibility seems like a whole lot of tech debt that doesn’t bring in any money.” And when you’re talking to a person you can generate that empathy and you can say it’s not just for people that have permanent disabilities, it’s for you. It’s for you when you’re in that noisy bar, it’s for you when you are holding that baby, it’s for you when you have had your eyes dilated after, you know, a doctor’s exam. You know, it’s for you if you’ve broken your arm, it’s not for other people, it’s for you and it’s for your family. But when you're talking about a business and you’re talking about the financial sides it can be really difficult to generate that empathy, because a business isn’t a feeling thing.

That’s just permanent disabilities. So, say for a moment, that you do have all of the accessibility features available, or at least, you’ve made it good enough that a lot of the accessibility conditions are covered. That means that your website is now accessible to 19-20% more people than you had before. If this is the type of website that generates revenue through their website, you’re looking at possibly up to 20% more revenue, just by incorporating accessibility features, you know? When was the last time that you set up software that added 20% to your revenue? If you have a $10 Million company, that makes it instantly a $12 Million company."

Same thing goes for the websites, by making them easier for people to use, making them clearer to navigate, being more clean and concise when you’re talking about text on the website, you’re making it easier for everyone to use at that point, under any circumstance."
