      "text": "One particular thing that stood out to me was the nature of our apps to always be celebrating or always be, sometimes excessively excited, and cheer for some of the smallest things. For example, say you go and you make your first post on something and you get confetti that’s bursting on the screen saying “Hooray!” and it may be a good thing, but perhaps your first post is not something that is so exciting or shouldn’t be celebrated. That is something that I feel like is really systemic in software that I encounter today. There’s always lots of cheering, sometimes maybe even because it’s gamified to give you that little dopamine hit or something, but that is one issue that I think that the book brings up about apps. "

So, it really hit home that concept of not all things are necessarily meant to be celebrated, and not all things are right to be celebrated. And yes it’s great that I got to spend the time with her that I did, however I didn’t necessarily need to be reminded on almost the anniversary of her death that she’s not here anymore.

And I think it’s one of those situations where the near blind pursuit for clicks and engagement can cloud the fact that the internet and digital experiences aren’t always rosy places for people and that your motivation shouldn’t be, “How do we get somebody to click on an ad and put them in an emotional state where they’re more likely to click on ads?” Because sometimes it can backfire on you. I think that kind of was the- seemed to be the underlying thread behind all of these stories was how companies make choices that are designed to increase how much money they earn, not necessarily how much joy or health their customers derive from a product.

But generally what was happening was people would go and put in, simply a… Maybe a racial profile and that’s about it, and because it was just a big blank form they had a certain engagement ratio, and Nextdoor actually took some steps to go and counter that by first when you are filling out the form, rather than making it just be a big blank text area, instead asking specific questions to encourage you to include other details other than those that could be racist or sexist, and then their engagement with that feature of the application actually fell, which is actually a good thing.

It’s like, what are the stressors that these people may be under at any given time, because the products are meant for people, they’re not meant for the AI’s that are solving whatever solutions that the companies want, you know? So, you know, if we have these happy cheerful things, what are the stress cases?

      "text": "One of the things that was mentioned in the book that I thought was interesting and it’s similarly around kind of the health space, was they cited the smart scale that had a partner app that automatically assumed that you were trying to lose weight. So, when it would send you notifications about your weight it would often say things like, “Congrats! You’ve dropped X number of pounds!” or “Hey, you only weigh this much!”, and I thought it was interesting because right after, or a couple of days after I read that section of the book my new Fitbit had arrived that I’d just purchased and I kind of started to place a really sharp focus on the experience of setting up the Fitbit and what kind of information it was requesting about myself and my body, and one of the things that I noticed and I think was a really good design decision on the part of Fitbit that contradicts with what the smart scale did, I’m not sure what company or brand that was, was that Fitbit kind of took a neutral position to how they asked you about your weight goals. So, when you set it up it asks you, “Do you want to lose, gain, or maintain weight?” and then it asks you to, you know, set the goal weight that you have, and I’ve been using it for a couple… About a little over a week now, and one thing I’ve noticed is I haven’t gotten any notification that have text that kind of insinuated or assumed I had a particular goal of losing weight, and the entire experience of the product was kind of like, very neutral. It wasn’t making any assumptions about what I wanted to do with my body or what my goals were. So, that was kind of a cool thing to see and be on the lookout for after I’d read that section of the book, was how were a lot of the health apps that I’m using making assumptions about my body and what I want, and whether or not they’re harmful. So, good job Fitbit! If anyone from Fitbit is listening. "

      "text": "I remember way back in the day when Michael Jordan was amazing and on the front page of every sports thing, there was the argument that BMI was not very accurate because Michael Jordan, in all of his full glory, was considered morbidly obese because he was 300 lbs, and it turns out, you know, he’s 300 lbs of muscle and he’s very tall, but he was considered morbidly obese based on BMIs. And then there was the example in the book that says, you know, “Oh! You lost a baby. Hurray! You’re at your lowest weight!” or “Oh, you’re anorexic. Hurray! You’re at your lowest weight!” You know? Or, “Oh you’re 29 lbs because you’re 2 years old. Oh, I’m sorry that you’ve gained a couple of pounds, but here’s some things that you can do to get them off!” You know? So, you know, it’s really… It is very true that we need to take into account each individual body and I really, really enjoyed the example where they were trying to find the average size of a pilot and therefore they were making the cockpit fit that size. So what they ended up doing was taking every pilot in a 300 group… Was it a 100 or a 300 group set? And they took measurements from every single pilot from height to wrist circumference to chest circumference and head circumference and measurements in between trying to determine what size this was, and they found the average. And then they tried to find the pilot that would fit that average, and they figured out that there was not a single pilot in the set who actually qualified for more than 2 of the measurements. So, the reality of “average”, the “average” person, doesn’t exist. There is no such thing as the average person. What they ended up doing is making the cockpit fit both the largest and the smallest person with adaptations in between in order to make each pilot comfortable, because there is no average. "

However, when you sign up the very first time, you only have that male and female choice, and that allowed the company to say that they had that gender diversity and the freedom to be able to make yourself who you are, but they got the male or female binary from you at the very beginning on sign up in order to appease the advertisers who wanted to use those metrics as focus groups in order to advertise to you. So, they started out with the binary and once you got in you got to change the defaults, and since most people won’t change the defaults once they get past that point, you’re still qualifying for a lot of that advertising.

One example of this for me, is on Zarf, which is the startup product I built, there is a registration form that asks people for their first and lasst name and there’s like virtually no checks on what you type besides like, you know, don’t like, try and hack my app with some sort of evil script or anything.

There’s no limitations on whether you want like, to put hyphens or apostrophes or things like that in it, and I haven’t had any problems with it so far, like, I also haven’t gotten to situations where I have a large enough user base where those problems might occur, but it was something that was kind of trivial for me to do and take into account, but has improved the experience for customers or users with, you know, I don’t want to say “non-traditional” but just names that might be considered stress cases or edge cases.

So, after trying to type with a hyphen it didn’t work, I tried typing with a space and that didn’t work, so I just squished it together and my wife has run into all sorts of issues because her name is now 22 characters long and some places just cut you off at 20 characters. So, she got a new job and her email address was RebeccaGarrettHarr. And having a hyphen can be weird too, because you… A lot of email addresses, and her work at least, they put a dash between the first and last name, and then there’s an actual dash in her last name. So they fixed her email, but now it’s GarrettHarris, with no dash. It’s Rebecca-GarrettHarris. So, yes, I’m much more aware of this problem now. "

That was really… I think that was the biggest eye-opening portion is the fact that I, you know, I choose caucasian, I choose white on those things, but I don’t have any other reason not to. So, it just… It hadn’t quite reached my thought process that that was a thing, you know?

I personally don’t identify as African American, I identify as black, because I wasn’t born here and I don’t have like, American heritage, or you know, family who was born here or anything like that. And that was something that caused me a lot of anxiety when I was growing up because there’d be these forms and it’d be like, you know, “White, Hispanic, African-American, Asian, so on and so forth…” I was like, well I’m not really any of these things, I’m something that I’m like, I belong to an identity that I guess people aren’t thinking about. And like I said, it happens less so now, I think most forms have the Black/African American, which kind of accepts individuals of African heritage who aren’t born or from American families, which is cool.

I’m not sure if the book mentioned it, I might be confusing it with something I read along the book, but there’s the, I think, famous story of IBM and their involvement during the Holocaust, and like, the alliances they made with the Nazis with the respect to like, data collection and stuff. I’m not well informed on this so I probably shouldn’t speak about it at the moment, but I know there were instances in the past where technology was used to make it easier for individuals to harm people based on the data they knew about them.

Or the fact that in Asia, the facial recognition for unlocking your phone, could be unlocked by your friend based on the similarities on facial structure and how it’s not just data collection that’s the problem, it’s also lack of diverse QA even. The fact that these things went from idea to being installed in bathrooms as soap dispensers and a dark-skinned person can’t get soap out of it, just baffles me. The fact that it went all the way to production and those companies have phones that are openable by a large swath of people, your coworker, and they call them secure and Asia, specifically, has a really huge technology market. So, to release something to such a large technology market that’s supposed to be even more secure than a fingerprint, and then to have it be the exact opposite, that half the people that you know can unlock your phone, is just confounding. How did it make it this far? And the only thing I can think of is it does come around to a distinct lack of diverse product development and QA. There was one example that I like to tell of, you know, this company had this idea where they were going to be able to have an app on your phone that all you’d have to do it tap it and it would start audio recording. So in the event that you needed to kind of inconspicuously start recording like, “Oh, this is a terrible situation, please record.” And it was meant more specifically for like, teachers. And this woman came into it and she says, “Okay, you realize that women’s pants don’t have pockets, right? And that a lot of teachers are women.” So there’s a couple different places that women tend to put their phones if they’re carrying them. One of them is in their back pocket, and one of them is in their bra. So, you’re literally asking a woman to spank her butt, or her boobs to start an audio recording to protect her, and it was killed at that point because it wasn’t feasible, but that was, you know, it took a woman to come in here and say, “Well that’s not gonna work” for that to happen. So, for these other things to happen that’s so big and so public, it’s like, how did you get that far? And the only thing I can think of is that there’s just a distinct lack of QA.

Since Zarf is a market place product and writers can sell their work on the platform, one of the things that I need to do is collect like, the last 4 digits of their social security number if they’re based in the United States, their address, their name, their birthday, and all of that is required to verify their identity and that’s specifically in part to be in compliance with some federal regulations that came out of the Patriot Act that just require you to confirm the identity of anyone who is going to be making money on your platform; but, one of the things I’ve consistently run into is a lot of my customers get really nervous, and rightfully so, when they realize they have to provide all of this sensitive information in order to use the platform, and I’m kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place. Because on the one hand it’s something that I do have to do, to like, be in federal compliance, but on the other hand I have to find a way to empathetically and effectively communicate why that information is being collected, where it’s stored, how it’s being used to customers so that they’re not frightened or anxious when they use the application. So it’s like a tough line to cross. "
